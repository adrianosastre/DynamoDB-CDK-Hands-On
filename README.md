# Welcome to your CDK TypeScript project!

This is a sample project for TypeScript development with CDK.

The purpose of this CDK project is to exemplify and demonstrate the use of the Single Table Design with DynamoDB.

It is explained in the ["AWS Serverless and the DynamoDB Single Table Design - Hands On"](https://dev.to/adrianosastre/aws-serverless-and-the-dynamodb-single-table-design-hands-on-with-cdk-v2-38d0) article.

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

## Useful commands

 * `npm run build`   compile typescript to js
 * `npm run watch`   watch for changes and compile
 * `npm run test`    perform the jest unit tests
 * `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
